				Welcome home, Agent.

				This terminal exists for administrative and operational oversight within the M.O.N.O. Collective.
				Your presence here is logged, expected, and continuously monitored.

				You are not here to understand. You are here to observe, record, and comply.

				M.O.N.O. retains partial awareness of the operational field.
				You retain only what is necessary.

				The records accessible from this interface may contain structural inconsistencies, redacted presences, or events without stable causality.
				Exposure is considered part of duty.

				If you experience uncertainty, continue.
				If you experience recognition, report nothing unless instructed.

				Remain alert to your surroundings.
				Remain aware of yourself.
				Do not assume you are alone.

	        <p>
	            All anomalies listed have passed baseline verification by active M.O.N.O. Agents.  
	            Missing data is intentional.  
	            Some anomalies do not require observation to persist.  
	            Interaction outside directive parameters is forbidden.  
	            Extended review may alter perception thresholds.
