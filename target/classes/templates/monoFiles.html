        <h1>The M.O.N.O. Files</h1>
        <p>
			This site is provided as a limited appendice of M.O.N.O., designed to make you attentive to your surroundings.
			M.O.N.O. knows very little; you know even less. But we are not alone. Not anymore.
			The documents you are about to encounter have been prepared for observation only.
			Access to this material is permitted under strict supervision.
			Note that the scope of the records extends beyond typical comprehension and may induce discomfort or uncertainty.
			Some entries reference events, presences, or interactions that are intentionally obfuscated.
			The act of reading constitutes acknowledgment of exposure; any effect on perception is not the responsibility of M.O.N.O.
			Proceed at your own discretion. Consider carefully whether further engagement is warranted.
			All personnel and external viewers are advised: prolonged review is discouraged.

        <h2><a th:href="@{/mono/anomalies}">ANOMALIES</a></h2>
        <p>
            The anomalies listed here have been verified by M.O.N.O. Agents according to strict observation protocols.  
            Patterns are recorded where detectable, gaps and inconsistencies are intentional.  
            Some anomalies may manifest subtly, invisibly, or beyond ordinary comprehension.  
            Interaction, interpretation, or dissemination outside authorized channels is strictly forbidden.  
            Prolonged review may induce perceptual strain.  
            Stay aware of your environment while consulting these records.

            Note: Some entries reference presences or events intentionally obscured. Observing may have consequences.

        <h2><a th:href="@{/mono/official-threads}">OFFICIAL THREADS</a></h2>
        <p>
            These threads represent sanctioned communications between M.O.N.O. Agents.  
            They include discussions of verified events, procedural notes, and internal assessments.  
            Content is archived, curated, and often deliberately oblique.  
            Some items may appear to reference nonexistent events or entities; casual reading may induce unease.  
            Access does not grant privilege to intervene or respond.  
            Threads are subject to modification or redaction without notice.

        <p class="warning">
            Advisory: Extended engagement may produce psychological or perceptual strain. Proceed only if necessary.
