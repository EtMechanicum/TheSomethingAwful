        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The M.O.N.O. Collective is not a governing body, nor an authority vested
            with executive power. No formal mandate exists. No centralized command
            has ever been established.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants are ordinary individuals, acting independently, united only
            by sustained curiosity and prolonged exposure to irregular phenomena.
            Any implication of influence, control, or intent beyond observation is
            unfounded.
        </p>

        <h2>Operational Origin</h2>
        <p>
            The earliest recorded coordination event is attributed to the
            <strong>Grey Wake Incident</strong> (1998-11-04), initially classified as
            unrelated data noise. Subsequent cross-referencing revealed recurring
            markers later assigned provisional codes (e.g. MN-002, MN-009).
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time, no formal framework existed. Documentation practices emerged
            organically, often retroactively, following loss of primary witnesses.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Scope of Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            Records maintained by the Collective include, but are not limited to:
            anomalous presences, non-repeatable events, spatial inconsistencies, and
            entities catalogued under standardized code naming conventions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain designations (e.g. MN-014, MN-021) are known to reference
            overlapping incidents across multiple geographic and temporal contexts.
            Correlation does not imply comprehension.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="dossier-section">
        <h2>Limitations & Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
            It is formally acknowledged that the Collective understands very little.
            Observers understand less. The absence of definitive conclusions should
            not be interpreted as absence of presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not alone. This statement is not speculative, but its implications
            remain deliberately unexpanded.
